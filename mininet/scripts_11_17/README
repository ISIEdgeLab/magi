Case study 1

Instructions for Running case study 1 on mininet

1. Location of files
	- Apache agent is located in scripts_11_12 directory
	- No change in Http-client agent
	- PktCounter agent is in same directory (scripts_11_17)
	- change AAL file to correctly specify location of agents and location of node configuration files on local machine

2. Running Case study
	$ sudo ./case_study_1.py -a cs_procedure.aal
	- This creates 2 node topology with hosts h1 and h2. 
	- It starts magi daemon on each host(with h1 being TCP server)
	- Next it starts magi orchestrator on h1 with the aal script provided and executes case study 1.

	$ sudo ./case_study_1.py -a cs_procedure_monitor.aal
	- This is similar to previous case except it starts packet counter agent on h1 for monitoring data flow

	It also generates graph of data flow. Necessary commands are added inside script for automation purpose.
