This is for REST API simulation of case study 1.

It uses Bottle framework to listen to REST API calls.

Generate mininet topology and create Rest API listener by running

$ sudo ./resttest.py

Once REST server is up, The folowing commads can be run.
 
1. To start apache server,
$ curl localhost:8080/cmd/h1/apache2%20-k%20start

This brings up the HTTP/Apache server on node h1. 

To run http client command
$ curl localhost:8080/run_http_client/<value>

Client queries HTTP server on h1 to get packet of specified size(value).
Default is 1000

To return to CLI/ mininet command prompt
$ curl localhost:8080/goto_cli
 
To stop the network
$ curl localhost:8080/stop


Assumptions
1. As of now Packet counter agent is not running. So Magi graph tool will not work.
2. MongoDB instances are not started. So there is no data stored for magi graph tool
