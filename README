Basic Install
==============
The backend is distributed as a python module archive.  To create the archive
run:

python setup.py sdist

This will create dist/MAGI-1.0.tar.gz.  For a quick update of the current
install you can run:

python setup.py sdist toshare

In addition to creating the distribution, it will also copy updated files to
/share/magi/v100.  A different path can be specified with the -p argument.


Other Required Software
=======================

If magi_bootstrap.py is used to install the backend distribution, you will also
need source archives in the same directory of:

PyYAML-*.tar.gz
unittest2-*.tar.gz

Not required but to be eventually used, you can also provide "yaml-*.tar.gz" to
compile as a C extension for PyYAML.


Software Directories
====================

If /etc/magi.conf is found on a node when the backend is started, that
configuration will be used.  If not, a default configuration is created.  Part
of this configuration specifies location to look for other software to install.
An example from a Ubuntu 10 machine is:

- {type: apt}
- {dir: /share/magi/v100/Linux-Ubuntu10.10-i686, type: rpmfile}
- {dir: /share/magi/v100/Linux-Ubuntu10.10-i686, type: archive}
- {dir: /share/magi/v100/source, type: source}
- {dir: /tmp/src, type: source}

As you can see, if will look in the directory that magi_boostrap is started
from for RPM's, archives or source distributions.
